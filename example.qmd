title: "Tooltips Example"

---

The goal of this extension is to make it easy to include bootstrap tooltips. This is accomplished with:

```{shortcodes=false}
What is a tooltip? {{<tooltips tooltip="This is a tooltip" >}}
```

produces:

What is a tooltip? {{<tooltips tooltip="This is a tooltip" >}}

For now, the tool tip is always attached to a bootstrap info icon.
