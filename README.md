You can also have the link on text:

```{shortcodes=false}
This is a tooltip on {{<tooltips tooltip="This is a tooltip on text." text='some text'>}}.
```

or change to a different bootstrap icon:

```{shortcodes=false}

There will be a tooltip on this info-square icon: {{<tooltips tooltip="This is a tooltip on info-square" icon='info-square'>}}.

```
